# Weekly Report 1

## Hours spent
6 hours in total. Breakdown below:

| Amount | Description                 |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| 2      | Lecture                     |
| 3      | Reading about Markov chains |
| 1      | Writing documentation       |

## What has been achieved this week?
A good foundation has been laid for the project.

## What have I learned?
Basic knowledge of how Markov chains work.

## Problems encountered
Choice of programming language. I had hard time choosing between Python, Java and JavaScript. Eventually I decided to do the program in Python since I know the language well enough to do projects like this with it but I havent done any before. I kinda wanted to do the program in JavaScript since it could be a webapp and you could run it on your browser, but I didn't feel comfortable enough with it since my experience with JavaScript is limited. Java would've been the safe choice, since it's the language I used in *Datastructures and algorithms* course and in *Software engineering (Ohjelmistotekniikka)*.

## What's next?
Creating the basic structure of the program; at least a CLI, maybe a GUI since it could be helpful to have it. First look into the implementation of Markov chains.
